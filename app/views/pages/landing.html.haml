          Vetrify consists of a team of entrepreneurs, software engineers and business professionals on a mission to redesign the hiring process. As undergraduates at UBC, we have first hand experience with the problems that students face during their job search. We are tired of the inefficiencies in the traditional system and have set out to improve the process for our fellow students.

          When we aren’t working our butts off, you can find us at our favourite watering hole, Koerner’s Pub, enjoying a growler with nachos.
